#  Given a large set of key-value pairs of string. Load it into such a data structure (or create your own) which will  
   support fast lookup of a keys and also consume less memory. 


#  Write a program, preferably in C++ which will take the following 2 files:	
   input.csv, test.txt

#  Input_CSV file containing a key value pair of 1L words.
   Test_TEXT file containing a set of keys


#  Measure lookup time
	Read the Input_CSV file and load it into your data structure. 

	Read from Test_TEXT file into an Array. Lookup all the keys from test set and measure the time taken to do so. Display the time to lookup as output in nanoseconds. 


#  Expected Program Outputâ€™s Format

>> executable input.csv test.txt
